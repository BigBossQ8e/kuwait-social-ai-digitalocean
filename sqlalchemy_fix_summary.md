# SQLAlchemy Registration Fix Summary

## Issue Found
Multiple SQLAlchemy instances were being created:
- `app_factory.py` - Created its own instance
- `models.py` - Created its own instance  
- `models/__init__.py` - Created its own instance

This caused the error:
```
RuntimeError: The current Flask app is not registered with this 'SQLAlchemy' instance
```

## Fix Applied
1. **Kept single instance** in `models/__init__.py`
2. **Removed instances** from:
   - `app_factory.py` - Now imports from models
   - `models.py` - Now imports from models
3. **All files now use the same db instance**

## Current Status
✅ **Only one SQLAlchemy instance exists**
✅ **Backend starts without SQLAlchemy errors**
✅ **All model relationships are properly configured**
❌ **Login still returns 400 Bad Request**

## What We've Accomplished
1. Fixed all model relationship errors
2. Cleaned up non-existent model references
3. Resolved multiple SQLAlchemy instance issue
4. Backend is now structurally sound

## Remaining Issue
The 400 Bad Request appears to be a request validation issue at the Flask/HTTP level, not related to:
- SQLAlchemy configuration ✅ Fixed
- Model relationships ✅ Fixed
- Database connectivity ✅ Working

The issue might be:
- Request parsing/validation
- CORS configuration
- Middleware interference
- Content-Type handling
