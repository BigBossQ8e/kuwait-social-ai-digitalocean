# Bilingual Deployment Status

## ✅ Completed Steps

1. **Frontend Build**: Successfully built with bilingual support
2. **Backend API**: Translations endpoint working at `/api/translations`
   - English: `https://kwtsocial.com/api/translations?locale=en`
   - Arabic: `https://kwtsocial.com/api/translations?locale=ar`
3. **Deployment**: Frontend deployed to production server
4. **Title Updated**: Page shows "Kuwait Social AI" instead of "Vite + React + TS"

## 🔍 Current Status

The bilingual support is **deployed** but the language switcher is not visible on the landing page. The translations API is working correctly and returning both English and Arabic content.

## 📝 What's Working

- ✅ Translations API endpoint (`/api/translations`)
- ✅ i18n initialized in the frontend
- ✅ Arabic content exists in the JavaScript bundle
- ✅ LanguageSwitcher component added to AppLayout
- ✅ Frontend deployed with correct title

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Language Switcher Not Visible**: The LanguageSwitcher component is included in the code but not appearing on the landing page
2. **Default Content**: The page might be showing default content instead of the full application

## 🚀 Next Steps

To see the bilingual functionality:
1. Login to the application at https://kwtsocial.com/login
2. Once logged in, the language switcher should appear in the top navigation bar
3. Click on "العربية" to switch to Arabic or "English" to switch back

## 📊 API Test Results

```bash
# English translations
curl https://kwtsocial.com/api/translations?locale=en

# Arabic translations  
curl https://kwtsocial.com/api/translations?locale=ar
```

Both endpoints return proper translation data for the application.
