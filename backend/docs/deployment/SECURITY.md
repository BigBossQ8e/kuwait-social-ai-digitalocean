# Security Guidelines for Kuwait Social AI Backend

## Critical Security Updates Applied

### 1. Removed Legacy Code
- Removed `app.py` which used direct initialization instead of the factory pattern
- This prevents accidental usage of insecure configurations

### 2. Fixed Application Structure
- Removed redundant celery assignment in `app_refactored.py`
- Improved code clarity and reduced potential for errors

### 3. Enhanced CORS Security
- CORS now properly validates origins from configuration
- Wildcard origins (`*`) are automatically removed in production
- Added support for credentials with proper CORS configuration
- Default to localhost:3000 only if no origins are specified

### 4. Secured Configuration Management
- Removed hardcoded secrets from `config.py`
- Production configuration now requires explicit environment variables
- Development configuration uses clearly marked development-only defaults
- Added proper validation to ensure critical secrets are set

### 5. Updated Dependencies
- Flask updated to 3.0.0 for latest security patches
- Werkzeug updated to 3.0.1 (critical security update)
- SQLAlchemy, cryptography, and other packages updated for security
- All vulnerable dependencies have been patched

### 6. Added Security Middleware
- Implemented comprehensive security headers for production
- Added XSS protection, frame options, and content type sniffing prevention
- Configured HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Added referrer and permissions policies

## Environment Variables

### Required for Production
```bash
# Generate strong secrets using:
# python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

SECRET_KEY=<64-character-hex-string>
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<64-character-hex-string>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://api.yourdomain.com
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - Use `.env.example` as a template
2. **Rotate secrets regularly** - Especially after any potential exposure
3. **Use strong passwords** - Minimum 32 characters for production secrets
4. **Limit CORS origins** - Never use wildcards in production
5. **Enable HTTPS** - Always use TLS in production
6. **Monitor logs** - Check `/logs/kuwait-social-ai.log` regularly
7. **Keep dependencies updated** - Run security audits regularly

### Running Security Audits

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
pip install safety
safety check

# Audit dependencies
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit
```

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set all required environment variables
- [ ] Remove development defaults from production config
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins (no wildcards)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS on the server
- [ ] Set up proper firewall rules
- [ ] Configure rate limiting appropriately
- [ ] Enable security monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Review and test all security headers
- [ ] Implement proper backup procedures
- [ ] Set up log rotation and monitoring
