## üîß Technical Requirements

### Backend Changes Needed:
1. **New Models**:
   - PlatformConfig
   - FeatureFlag
   - Package
   - PackageFeature
   - APIKeyConfig
   - AdminActivity

2. **New Services**:
   - ConfigurationService
   - FeatureFlagService
   - PackageService
   - RealtimeService
   - AnalyticsService

3. **New APIs**:
   - `/api/admin/platforms/*`
   - `/api/admin/features/*`
   - `/api/admin/packages/*`
   - `/api/admin/config/*`
   - `/api/admin/realtime/*`

### Frontend Requirements:
1. React components for all toggle systems
2. Real-time update handlers
3. Configuration state management
4. Analytics visualization
5. Responsive admin dashboard

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Start with Platform/Feature Toggles**: Core functionality that affects all other features
2. **Implement WebSocket Early**: Many features depend on real-time updates
3. **Use Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout of new admin features
4. **Create Admin API v2**: Separate namespace for new admin features
5. **Add Telemetry**: Track admin usage to improve UX

The gap between the HTML mockup vision and current implementation is significant but achievable with focused development sprints.
