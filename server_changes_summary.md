# Server Changes Summary

## Comparison with Local Folder

### Changes Made on Server:
1. **Many files modified today** (June 28, 2025)
   - All model files have been updated
   - New file: `models/campaign_fixed.py`
   - Backup directories created: `models.backup-20250628-010354/`

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **All SQLAlchemy ORM relationship errors fixed**:
   - Campaign.posts → Added Post.campaign_id FK
   - CompetitorAnalysis relationships → Added analysis_id FKs
   - HashtagStrategy relationships → Added strategy_id FKs
   - MessageThread.original_message → Added relationship

2. ✅ **Backend now starts without ORM errors**
   - All model relationships properly configured
   - Foreign keys added where needed
   - back_populates used for bidirectional relationships

### Current Status:
- ✅ Backend running (no SQLAlchemy errors)
- ✅ All services up (PostgreSQL, Redis, Frontend)
- ❌ Login endpoint returns 400 Bad Request
- ✅ Other endpoints respond (e.g., /api/auth/profile returns 422)

### Remaining Issue:
The 400 Bad Request on login is NOT related to:
- SQLAlchemy models (all fixed)
- Marshmallow (installed and working)
- Schema validation (tested successfully)

It appears to be a request handling issue, possibly:
- Request parsing before validation
- Middleware intercepting POST requests
- Content-Type handling issue

### What Was NOT Found:
- No CompetitorStrategyMetric model exists (reference was cleaned up)
- No TelegramAccount or APIKey models referenced in current error logs

The server has been significantly updated with many model fixes beyond what was in the local folder.
